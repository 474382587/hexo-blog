# Here is a useful website I have discovered online

https://picsum.photos/

You are able to their placeholder images as simple as --> https://picsum.photos/200/300 where 200 is the width and 300 is the height    
If you wish to use a square image --> https://picsum.photos/200 will do the trick    
Even more, you can add searching params "?random" to the end to get random placeholder images :)
